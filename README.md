# vue-snake

## Project setup
The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with the Vue framework and use JavaScript and Canvas to create a basic game. It was a fun pet project. I might do the same in C, and Python to improve

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
yarn lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

### Things to add for later (If interested)
* Score Board
* Not allowing snake to reverse into itself and lose game
* Better graphics
